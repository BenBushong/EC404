# Choice over Time


**Exponential discounting:** When a person receives utility at different points in time, she seeks to maximize her *intertemporal utility*:

$$U \equiv u_{1}+\delta u_{2}+\delta ^{2}u_{3}+...+\delta ^{T-1}u_{T}$$

--

or put another way: 
$$= \sum_{t=1}^{T}\delta ^{t-1}u_{t}\text{.}$$
--

- $u_{t}$ is her **instantaneous utility** in period $t$ (or her "well-being" in period $t$).

--
	
- $\delta$ is her **discount factor**, where $\delta \in (0,1]$.

# 401(k) Savings


401(k) savings is the most common voluntary savings vehicle in the US. In brief:

- Purpose is to let people set aside money for retirement

- Free choice of contribution rate, and (mostly free choice) over asset allocation

- Generally large penalties for early withdrawal

- Employer sometimes pays matching contribution up to a threshold.
	
- Tax deferred: employee pays (typically lower) marginal tax rate during retirement

--

# Patterns of 401(k) Investment `r Citep(myBib, Choi2005)`

- Two thirds of employees believe that they are saving too little.
		
- A quarter of these intend to raise their savings in the next 2 months.

- Almost nobody follows through.
	
- Reported undersavers have low savings rates.
	
- (Similar patterns in other surveys)
		
---
class: MSU 
# Discussion Points

**Should** people save more? 

Can we trust self-reported desires / interests? 

- Consumption drops discretely at retirement, which might suggest under-saving
				
- But it's hard to show that people undersave [http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/erik.hurst/research/retirement_consumption_survey_nber_final.pdf](Erik Hurst's work)
	
- Increased saving from automatic enrollment may come from more debt rather than from reduced consumption `r Citep(myBib, "beshears2017borrowing")`
	
--

### Costs of Non-Participation

- Foregone tax benefits

- Foregone employer match

- (Implicitly) foregone consumption smoothing
	
---
class: MSU
# Tools to Combat Underuse

There are a set of typically applied tools that employers use to increase savings in 401ks.

- Financial education (we'll discuss this more later)

- Vary employer matching contribution

- Provide additional (or "better") choices
		
--

### The Power of Suggestion: `R Citet(myBib, "Madrian2001")`

Explores the impact of automatic enrollment on 401(k) savings behavior:
		
- 401(k) participation (yes/no)

- Contribution rates and asset allocation

# Breaking the 4th Wall

This was a tremendously successful paper. **Why?**

--

I conjecture all of the following played a role: 

- Concerns an *important* economic decision

- There are potentially large welfare effects

- Standard economics approaches were unsuccessful in raising savings

- Standard economics approaches have a hard time explaining default effects

--

In this sense, this paper provides a useful recipe for your own research and I encourage you to think about this type of environment.

# Details and Environment

### Madrian et al. 2001 Specifics

Data came from a large, publicly traded Fortune 500 health care company. Employees had flexibility and could enroll inthe  401(k) savings plan any day by:
	
- Filling out enrollment form, or

- calling the 401(k) record keeper.

$\Rightarrow$ Small direct transaction costs of starting/changing 401(k) allocation

--

Company had a 50% matching contribution for first 6%. (This is modal policy in "real world".)
	
- E.g., if an employee chooses 4%, the company pays an additional 2%. If an employee chooses 10%, the company pays an additional 3%.

- Employees first eligible after one year of employment (before change).

# Findings

The authors found a discontinuity of 401(k) plan **defaults** based on date of hire:
	
Cohort 1 was hired April 1996 to March 1997:

- Default: *no* enrollment

- 1-year wait period for eligibility

--

Cohort 2 was hired April 1997 to March 1998

- Default: *no* enrollment

- Wait period until April 1998
	
--

Cohort 3 hired April 1998 to March 1999

- Default: enrollment 
			
- 3 percent contribution rate

- 100 percent invested in money market fund (*Editorial comment:* gross)

- Can change both contribution rate and fund allocation at any time

# Enter: The Real World

The nature of the conflict between selves is often seen in our daily activities. 

However, as PhD Economists, we are often looking for smoking guns in the domain where our expertise lies (economics). 

--

In the next mess of slides, I will make the argument that one domain worthy of lots of additional exploration is *household finance.* 

I'll present a series of facts, many of which I will argue stem from a conflict between selves. But this is a bold assertion and you should be skeptical and inquisitive.

# Nine Facts About Household Finance

Households in the United States: 

1. Have low levels of financial literacy

2. Have very few liquid assets (live hand to mouth)

3. Have substantial illiquid wealth

4. Have a high marginal propensity to consume out of liquid wealth

5. Have a low marginal propensity to consume out of illiquid wealth

6. Choose suboptimal financial service products 

7. Barely change their behavior after financial education interventions

8. Have misaligned financial intentions and financial actions

9. Make financial choices that can be manipulated

# Financial Literacy 

(This is one of the only times I'll discuss such things in this course.)

Assessing literacy often comes down to simple questions such as: 

> Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year.  After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow?

>i) More than $102

>ii) Exactly $102

>iii) Less than $102

>iv) Don’t know 

>v) Refuse to answer



---
class: MSU 
# Financial Literacy 

> Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2% per year.  After 1 year, would you be able to buy with the money in this account:”

>i) More than today 

>ii) Exactly the same

>iii) Less than today

>iv) Don't know 

>v) Refuse to answer

# Financial Literacy 

> Do you think the following statement is true or false? Buying a single company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.

# Hand-to-Mouth Living

### A Fact

Forty-six percent of U.S. adults report that they either could not come up with $400 to cover an emergency expense, or would have to borrow or sell something to do so. (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2016).

--

### Another Fact

Most of these households are not negative net worth.

# Liquidity and Consumption 

- Shapiro (2005): People on food stamps exhibit a monthly caloric cycle wherein calories drop 10-15% over the month

--

- Parker (2014): Nielsen data around 2008 Economic Stimulus Payments suggests a within-year MPX of 60%

--

- Ganong and Noel (2016): when unemployment insurance runs out (a predictable event), household consumption drops by 11%.

--

- Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2020): "Low-liquidity winners of the smallest prizes (around $1500) are estimated to spend all within the year of winning. The corresponding estimate for high-liquidity winners of large prizes ($8300-150K) is slightly below one half."

--

- Gerard and Naritomi (2021): “Displaced workers eligible for both UI and SP increase consumption at layoff by 35% despite experiencing a 17% consumption loss after they stop receiving any benefits”

# Present-Biased Preferences

The **quasi-hyperbolic discount function** (Phelps and Pollak 1968, Laibson 1997, O'Donoghue and Rabin 1999):

$$D(\tau) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{ if } \tau = 0 \\
\beta \cdot \delta^{\tau} & \text{ if } \tau \in \{1, 2, \ldots\}
\end{cases}$$

where $\beta \leq 1$

--

- We can then write the utility function as:

$$U^{t} = u_{t} + \beta \sum_{\tau = 1}^{T-t} \delta^{\tau} u_{t+\tau}$$

# Present-Biased Preferences

### Intuitive Example 

(*Courtesy of Matthew Rabin*) Suppose there is a task that you must complete on one of the next four days.

To complete this task, you incur costs as follows: 

- If you complete the task in period 1, the cost is 3.

- If you complete the task in period 2, the cost is 5. 

- If you complete the task in period 3, the cost is 8.

- If you complete the task in period 4, the cost is 13.

--

Suppose there is no reward, that you value costs linearly, and that you have $\beta =1/2$ and $\delta =1$.
