<div class="fyi">
<p><strong>This assignment is due Tuesday, January 23rd in class. If you like, you may turn it in via D2L, but in-person is fine also.</strong></p>
<p>Click the icon to download the problem set: <a href="/ps/PS1.pdf"><i class="fas fa-file-download"></i></a>.</p>
<p>You need not type your solutions if you turn in via D2L; a (reasonably clear) photo is sufficient.</p>
