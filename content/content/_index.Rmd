There are no required readings for this class.

The course content is structured as follows. For each lecture, we begin with a set of questions that might guide your reading and help frame your thoughts. These questions can serve as helpful starting places for your thinking; they are not representative of the totality of the content and are not intended to be limiting. That said, they form a helpful guide to exam content.

If we go to an online format, lecture videos will be posted to this link [<i class="fas fa-film"></i>]().
