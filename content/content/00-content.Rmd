## Slides

Throughout the course, every set of class slides will be posted on this course website. Many are posted already, but do not rely on old versions. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF. You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

Please note: you may experience some performance issues when opening the PDF file with Preview; Adobe Acrobat does not have these problems.

`r blogdown::shortcode("slide-buttons")`

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
source(here::here("R/slide_tabs.R"))
source(here::here("R/pdfize.R"))
sections <- tibble::tribble(
  ~name, ~slide, ~active,
  "Top", "Cover", TRUE,
  "Key Info", "section2", FALSE,
 )
slide_tabs(sections, "/slides/00-Introduction.html")
pdfize(here::here("static/slides/00-Introduction.html"))
```

**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands; on some slides, this might give helpful hints!
