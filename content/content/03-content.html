<h2>A (Gentle) Reminder</h2>
<p>Problem sets are your main way of learning the material for this course. You ought to be engaging with them early and often. They don’t take a collosal amount of time, but they can be a real bear if you try to do them at the last minute. (And then you won’t learn things very well, if at all.)</p>
