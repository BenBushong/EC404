## Slides

Every single set of class slides can be found on this course website. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF. You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

Please note: you may experience some performance issues when opening the PDF file with Preview; Adobe Acrobat does not have these problems.

### Part 1:

`r blogdown::shortcode("slide-buttons")`

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
source(here::here("R/slide_tabs.R"))
source(here::here("R/pdfize.R"))
sections <- tibble::tribble(
  ~name, ~slide, ~active,
  "Top", "Cover", TRUE,
 )
slide_tabs(sections, "/slides/02-Evidence.html")
pdfize(here::here("static/slides/02-Evidence.html"))
```

**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands; on some slides, this might give helpful hints!
