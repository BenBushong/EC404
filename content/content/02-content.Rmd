These slides discuss evidence that goes against the expected-utility model and heavily emphasizes the groundbreaking work of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. If you'd like to read more about them, I recommend the book `The Undoing Project` by Michael Lewis.

## Slides

Please note: you may experience some performance issues when opening the PDF file with Preview; Adobe Acrobat does not have these problems.

### Evidence Contracticting the Standard Model: 

`r blogdown::shortcode("slide-buttons")`

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
source(here::here("R/slide_tabs.R"))
source(here::here("R/pdfize.R"))
sections <- tibble::tribble(
  ~name, ~slide, ~active,
  "Top", "Cover", TRUE,
 )
slide_tabs(sections, "/slides/02-Evidence.html")
pdfize(here::here("static/slides/02-Evidence.html"))
```

**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands; on some slides, this might give helpful hints!
