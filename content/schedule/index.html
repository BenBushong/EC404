<p>Below is a roadmap for the semester. Note that <strong>this will inevitably change</strong> from the first day you access this course but will be updated as required.</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The class is fundamentally based on lectures. The slides for the lectures can be found at the “content” page. Everything else should be relatively self-explanatory.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/content/"><strong>Content</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains the lectures and recorded videos (as applicable) for the topic. These pages should be read completely. Lectures are <em>not</em> an exact replication of the written content; on the contrary, the lectures are intended to keep you engaged and have a great deal more information than the slides alone. Come to class.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/assignment/"><strong>Assignments</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for assignments. <strong>Assignments are always due before the start of class.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
