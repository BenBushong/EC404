Below is a roadmap for the semester. Note that this will inevitably change from the first day you access this course but will be updated as required. 

### Overview

The class is fundamentally based on lectures. The slides for the lectures can be found at the "content" page. Everything else should be relatively self-explanatory.

- [**Content**](/content/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains the lectures and recorded videos (as applicable) for the topic. These pages should be read completely. Lectures are *not* an exact replication of the written content; on the contrary, the lectures are intended to keep you engaged and have a great deal more information than the slides alone. Come to class.

- [**Assignments**](/assignment/) (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for assignments. **Assignments are always due nefore the start of class.**
