Here are the two we've discussed so far:

## \#1: Carefully Define Your Environment

## \#2: Use Extreme Cases to Clarify Your Thinking

Have you memorized the bold definitions?

Have you tried thinking about extremes?

# Prospect Theory: A One-Slide Reminder

A person evaluates a prospect `\(\left( x_1,p_1;\dots; x_n,p_n\right)\)` according to:

`$$V\left( x_1,p_1;\dots; x_n,p_n\right) \quad =\sum_{i=1}^N \pi \left( p_i\right) v\left( x_i\right).$$`

--

Notable features:

- Value comes from **changes** in wealth, not absolute wealth
- `\(\pi(p) \neq p\)` implies people "mess up" probabilities
- Otherwise similar to expected utility. **Not** radical!

--

A commonly assumed form of `\(v(\cdot)\)` is

`$$v(x)=\{ x^{\alpha}\quad \text{ if }\quad x\geq 0$$`
`$$\quad \quad \quad \lambda (x)^{\beta}\quad \text{if }\quad x\leq 0$$`
and we'll often just drop the exponents.

---

# Applications of Prospect Theory

For many years, expected utility has been used by economists to capture risk preferences. Indeed, it is still used in almost all applications.

**But** economists are starting to recognize that some behaviors are hard to interpret in terms of expected utility; and for many such behaviors, prospect theory provides a natural interpretation.

--

To illustrate, we'll consider nine examples.

- I suspect much more work in this area in coming years.

- Only one example addresses probability weighting -- but I suspect it is running around in tons of seemingly-strange behaviors.

# Application \#1: The Samuelson Bet

### Example courtesy of Samuelson (1963)

Consider the following bet:

$$\text{win }\$200\text{ with prob }1/2$$
$$\text{lose }\$100\text{ with prob }1/2$$

--

Samuelson's colleague turned down this bet, but announced that he would accept 100 plays of the same bet.

--

Samuelson proved that his colleague was "irrational" --- by proving that it is inconsistent with expected-utility theory to turn down the single bet but accept 100 such bets.

--

But **was** his colleague "irrational"?

---

# Application \#1: The Samuelson Bet

**Class discussion:** Suppose that a person turns down the bet **at some wealth levels.** Does EU imply that the person must turn down 100 such bets?

--

**Continued:** Suppose that a person turns down the bet **at all wealth levels**. Does EU imply that the person must turn down 100 such bets?

--

What is the basic intuition?

---
class: MSU
# Application \#1: The Samuelson Bet


**Intuition:** Consider an individual who has said that he is unwilling to take one bet but is willing to play 100 such bets. Suppose this person has played 99 bets.

- If asked whether he would like to stop at this point he will say yes. By assumption, he dislikes one bet at any relevant wealth level.

- However, this means that if asked after 98 bets whether he would like to play number 99 he must also decline.

--

- He should realize (by backward induction) that he would reject bet 100, implying that bet 99 is a single play.

--

The same reasoning applies to the first bet.

**Thinking about economics grad school?** Prove this claim formally.

---
class: MSU
# Application \#1: The Samuelson Bet

Consider an alternative "model":

- Suppose that a person evaluates bets according to the value function

`$$v(x)= x \quad\text{if }~~~x \geq 0$$`
`$$v(x)= 2.5x \quad \text{if }~~~x\leq 0$$`

--

Consider the single bet `\(y=[200,.5;-100,.5]\)`.

--

Consider taking two such bets. This means you face aggregate gamble `\(z=[400,.25;100,.5;-200,.25]\)`.

--

**Point:** Unlike EU, loss aversion can lead a person to reject one play of the bet but to accept multiple plays of the bet.


---
class: MSU
#  Mental Accounting

### Note: The Previous Explanation Was Underspecified

*Mental accounting:* the process a person uses to interpret a choice situation.

--

- **Any** application of prospect theory requires a mental-accounting assumption.

- Typically, this requires an assumption about how people decide what are the objects for evaluation.

--

- E.g., Kahneman &amp; Tversky interpret the isolation effect as people ignoring seemingly extraneous parts of the problem.
- E.g., to explain the behavior of Samuelson's colleague, we assumed that the person collapses the aggregate bet into a single lottery and decides whether to accept that lottery.

--

- Sometimes, we must make an assumption about when and how people code outcomes as gains and losses. (We'll do this in later applications)


---
class: MSU
# Application \#2: Risk Aversion

People tend to dislike risky prospects even when they involve an expected gain.

--

Rabin &amp; Thaler's point, which should feel **very** repetitive by now:

- Calibrationwise, this explanation doesn't work, because according to EU, "anything but virtual risk neutrality over modest stakes implies manifestly unrealistic risk aversion over large stakes."

--

- Now we'll show that *loss aversion* is a useful alternative.

---
class: MSU
# Application \#2: Risk Aversion

Suppose you have wealth $20,000, and you turn down a 50-50 bet to win $110 vs. lose $100.

We showed that rejecting the bet implies that `\(\rho&gt;18.17026\)`.

**Question:** What about with loss aversion?

--

Two plausible features of preferences consistent with loss aversion:

1. How you feel about absolute gambles is largely insensitive to your wealth --- e.g., you might reject `\((101,.5;-100,.5)\)` for all `\(w\)`.

--

2. At the same time, scaling outcomes proportionally need not change your preferences much --- e.g., you might have

`$$(12,.5;-10,.5) \sim (0,1)$$`
`$$(120,.5;-100,.5) \sim (0,1)$$`
`$$(1200,.5;-1000,.5) \sim (0,1)$$`

# Application \#3: The Equity-Premium Puzzle

### Equity-Premium Puzzle (Mehra &amp; Prescott, 1985)

*Equity premium:* The difference between the returns on stocks and the returns on fixed-income securities.

- The (historical) equity premium is quite large. For instance, since 1926, the real return on stocks has been about 7%, and the real return on T-Bills has been about 1%.

--

**The puzzle:** The equity premium is "too large" --- Mehra and Prescott estimate that investors would need to have absurd levels of risk aversion to explain the historical equity premium.

---

class: MSU
# Financial Decisionmaking


### Standard Economics/Finance View of Financial Decisions
You have wealth `\(w\)`, and you use this wealth for your lifetime consumption profile `\((c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{T})\)`.

Your lifetime consumption profile yields lifetime utility

`$$u(c_{1})+\delta u(c_{2})+\delta ^{2}u(c_{3})+...+\delta ^{T-1}u(c_{T})$$`

--

Wealth that's targeted for future consumption is invested in financial assets (stocks and bonds).

- Hence, any risk in your financial portfolio gets translated into risk in future consumption.

- And therefore any risk aversion that have with regard to future consumption gets translated into risk aversion with regard to your financial portfolio.

---
class: MSU
# The Puzzle

Assume a CRRA utility function (over consumption):

`$$u(c)=\frac{(c)^{1-\rho }}{1-\rho }.$$`

--

- *Note:* The larger is `\(\rho\)`, the **less** risk one takes on in one's financial portfolio (fewer stocks, more bonds).

- Mehra &amp; Prescott show that to explain the observed equity premium, we need to assume that people have `\(\rho &gt;30\)`.

- But empirical estimates and theoretical arguments suggest `\(\rho \approx 1\)` (log utility) and definitely not more than 5. (Remember the exercise we did?)

---
class: inverseMSU 

# The Equity Premium Puzzle

### Two Interpretations for Mehra and Prescott Result

- Given the historical equity premium, under EU (and CRRA utility) people's observed willingness to hold a mix of stocks and bonds can be explained only by a `\(\rho &gt;30\)`, which is clearly absurd (i.e., it would imply absurd behavior in other domains).

--

- Given EU and reasonable levels of risk aversion ($\rho =1$ or perhaps even `\(\rho =5\)`), under the historical equity premium, we should observe people investing exclusively in stocks.

# "Myopic Loss Aversion"

Benartzi &amp; Thaler's explanation: "Myopic Loss Aversion"


- Two components: loss aversion and a specific mental-accounting assumption.

--

**Basic foundation:** From time to time, a person evaluates her portfolio and experiences joy/pain from watching it grow/shrink.



---
class: MSU
# Benartzi &amp; Thaler's Model

### Objects for Evaluation

Suppose a person evaluates her portfolio at dates

`$$t,t+\triangle ,t+2\triangle ,...$$`

--

Let `\(Y_{\tau }\)` be the value of her portfolio at date `\(\tau\)`.

Let `\(x_{\tau +\Delta }\equiv Y_{\tau +\Delta }-Y_{\tau }\)`.

--

At date `\(\tau\)`, person chooses between lotteries over `\(x_{\tau+\Delta}\)`.

--

**Key idea:** The person's portfolio allocation chosen at date `\(\tau\)` generates a lottery over `\(x_{\tau +\Delta}\)` --- that is, a lottery over how	her portfolio will change in value between now ( `\(\tau\)` ) and the next evaluation period ( `\(\tau +\Delta\)` ).

---
class: MSU
# Benartzi &amp; Thaler's Model

### A (Much) Simplified Example:

Suppose there are two assets, stocks and bonds, and that between `\(\tau\)` and `\(\tau +\Delta\)` the returns are:

- For bonds: `\((+1\%,1)\)`
- For stocks: `\((+10\%,\frac{1}{2};-5\%,\frac{1}{2})\)`

--

Suppose further that the person must choose a proportion `\(\alpha\)` of her wealth to invest in stocks, with the remainder invested in bonds. As a function of `\(\alpha\)`, the resulting lottery over `\(x_{\tau +\Delta}\)` is

`$$\text{Good Outcome:}\quad \quad  \alpha w(.10)+(1-\alpha )w(.01)\text{ },\text{ }\frac{1}{2}$$`
`$$\text{Bad Outcome:}\quad \quad \alpha w(-.05)+(1-\alpha )w(.01)\text{ },\text{ }\frac{1}{2}$$`

--

Again, at date `\(\tau\)`, person chooses between lotteries over `\(x_{\tau+\Delta}\)`.

&gt; Note: Major deviation from the standard approach!

---

class: MSU
# Benartzi &amp; Thaler's Model

### Evaluating Lotteries

At date `\(t\)`, person chooses her portfolio to maximize her "prospective utility"

`$$\sum_{x_{t+\Delta }}\pi (x_{t+\triangle })v(x_{t+\triangle })\text{.}$$`

--

Let's use the value function

`$$v(x)=x^{\alpha } \quad \quad \text{if }~~~x\geq 0$$`
`$$v(x)= -\lambda (-x)^{\beta } \quad \quad \text{if }~~~x\leq 0$$`

--

The authors assume `\(\alpha =\beta =.88\)` and `\(\lambda =2.25\)` (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992).

`\(\pi (x_{t+\triangle })\)` reflects probability weighting. The authors use the cumulative form --- including the suggested parameter values --- from Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992.

---
class: MSU
# Benartzi &amp; Thaler's Analysis

### General (Simulation) Approach

1. Draw samples from historical (1926-1990) monthly returns on stocks, 5-yr bonds, and T-Bills.

- E.g., if 10 observations of actual monthly returns on an asset were

`$$-2\%,1\%,0\%,1\%,-1\%,1\%,2\%,0\%,1\%,0\%$$`

... then for that asset they'd set `\(\Pr (1\%)=0.4\)`, `\(\Pr (0\%)=0.3\)`, etc.

--

2. Then, consider `\(n\)`-month evaluation periods, for `\(n=1,2,3,...\)`, where the distribution of returns for an `\(n\)`-month evaluation period is constructed from `\(n\)` IID draws from the distribution of monthly returns.

- E.g., if the monthly return distribution is `\((20\%,1/2;0\%,1/2)\)`, then the 2-month return distribution is `\((44\%,1/4;20\%,1/2;0\%,1/4)\)`.

---
class: MSU
# Benartzi &amp; Thaler's Analysis

### Results

**First question:**  What evaluation period `\(n\)` would make investors *indifferent* between holding all stocks vs. holding all bonds?

--

*Answer:* The historical data are consistent with their model applied as if people evaluated their portfolios about once a year.

--

**Second question:** Assuming yearly evaluations, what is the **optimal** mix of stocks and bonds?

*Answer:* The optimal holdings, given the historical data, are to hold roughly equal amounts in stocks and bonds (as we observe in the world).

# Application \#4: Non-Linear Probabilities

Snowberg and Wolfers (2010) explore non-linearity in probabilities "in the wild" by investigating horse-race bets.

--

If Horse A is 2:1 odds this should mean both:

1. That the implied probability of winning is `\(\frac{1}{3}\)`. Losing is twice as likely as winning and either the horse wins or loses.

2. If you put $1 on horse A, you either receive $3 ($2 winnings + $1 stake) or zero, since `\(\frac{1}{3} \times 3 + \frac{2}{3} \times 0 = 1\)`.

--

That is: Betting and not betting should yield the same expected return.

--

(Of course, there is a track profit such that the expected return is a bit negative. But we'll ignore this margin for now.)

--

**Point:** If all odds were appropriate, every horse would have equal expected value and thus equal expected returns.

---
class: MSU
# Application \#4: Non-Linear Probabilities

### Finding: The "Favorite-Longshot Bias"

- Longshots have low expected return, given how rarely they win...

--

- and bettors value favorites too little given how **often** they win.

--

- Concretely, betting on a horse with 100/1 odds yields returns of about -61%.

- Betting **randomly** yields average returns of -23%.

--

- Betting on a horse with 1/3 odds yields returns of only -5.5%

# Application \#5: The Disposition Effect

*"Disposition Effect"*: When investors sell their stocks, they are more prone to sell their winners than their losers.
--

- A stock is a "winner" if its current price is above its purchase price, and it is a "loser" if its current price is below its purchase price (as in Shefrin &amp; Statman 1985).

--


Odean (1998) provides a nice empirical test, and assesses several potential explanations.

---
class: MSU
# Application \#5: The Disposition Effect}

Odean (1998) has a dataset of individual traders at a small brokerage house and observes each individual's stock portfolio and all trades made each day.

--

For every individual-day on which he observes trades, he calculates:

1. "Proportion of Gains Realized":

`$$PGR\equiv \frac{\text{# of winners sold}}{\text{# of winners in portfolio}}$$`

--

2. "Proportion of Losses Realized":

`$$PLR\equiv \frac{\text{# of losers sold}}{\text{blog# of losers in portfolio}}$$`

--

**"Disposition Effect":** `\(PGR&gt;PLR\)`.

--

**Big Question:** What's the explanation?

---
class: MSU
# Application \#5: The Disposition Effect

Rational Explanation \#1: Sell winners to rebalance your portfolio.

--

- If the disposition effect is driven by rebalancing, then if we restrict attention to trades in which (i) only entire holdings of a stock are sold or (ii) no new purchases are made, we should no longer observe a disposition effect.

- When Odean does this, the effect *does not go away*.

--

Rational Explanation \#2: Sell winners because losers are better.

- Odean finds that the winners people sell *outperform* the losers they keep (over various horizons --- 1/3 year, 1 year, 2 years).

--

### Odean's Explanations

- Loss aversion with a mental-accounting assumption that you experience gain-loss utility for a particular stock when you sell that stock.

- Or an irrational belief in mean reversion.
