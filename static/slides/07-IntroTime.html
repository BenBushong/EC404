# Overview of Topic 2

## Topic 2: 
### Intertemporal Choice: Making Choices Over Time

Many interesting questions in economics involve choice over time:

- How do people allocate their wealth between current consumption and future consumption?

- How do people decide when to work on tasks?

- For goods that yield short-term consumption utility but generate negative consequences in the long-term---e.g., alcohol, cigarettes, potato chips---how do people trade off the short-term benefits vs. the long-term costs?

# Overview of Topic 2


The standard model ("exponential discounting") assumes:

1. People treat time in a relatively even-handed manner.

2. People carry out their plans.

3. People know what they'll like in the future.

# Today's Lecture

### Warm-Up: Interest Rates, Compounding, PDV

Let's understand the standard model and (quickly) do some example problems. (This is a great time to ask questions.)

class: MSU
# Interest Rates and Compounding

**Example A:** Suppose you put $1000 into a bank account that pays 10% interest per year.

- After 1 year, you'll have $1000 * (1.10) = $1100 .

- After 2 years, you'll have $1100 * (1.10)= $1210 .

- After 3 years, you'll have $1210 * (1.10)= $1331 .

--

More generally:

If you put `\(P\)` into a bank account that pays interest rate `\(r\)` per year, its future value in `\(T\)` years will be `\(P\ast(1+r)^{T}\)` .

---
class: MSU
# Interest Rates and Compounding

### Definitions (easy; hopefully not new)

*Compound interest* is interest paid on past interest earned.

--

*Compounding* is earning interest on past interest earned.

--

The **frequency of compounding** is the frequency at which interest is credited to your account (after which it's starts earning compound interest).

--

Our example above implicitly assumed yearly compounding. Of course, we could have more frequent compounding....

---
class: MSU
# Interest Rates and Compounding

**Example B:** Suppose you put $1000 into a bank account that pays a 10% annual interest rate that is compounded every six months.

Because a 10% annual interest rate implies a 5% semi-annual interest rate:

- After 6 months, you'll have `\(1000 \ast (1.05)= 1050\)` .

- After 1 year, you'll have `\(1050 \ast (1.05)= 1102.50\)` .

--

**Example C:** Suppose you put $1000 into a bank account that pays a 10%
annual interest rate that is compounded every month.

Because a 10% annual interest rate implies a `\(0.8\bar{3}\)` % monthly interest rate:

- After 1 year, you'll have `\((1000)\ast(1.008\bar{3})^{12}=1104.71\)` .



---
class: MSU
# Interest Rates and Compounding

More generally, if you put `\(P\)` into a bank account that pays an annual interest rate of `\(r\)` that is compounded `\(n\)` times per year:

- Its future value after 1 year will be `\((P)\ast (1+r/n)^{n}\)` .

- Its future value after `\(T\)` years will be `\((P)\ast \left[ (1+r/n)^{n} \right] ^{T}\)` .

--

- Note: For continuous compounding, `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}(1+r/n)^{n}=e^{r}\)` and `\(\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\left[ (1+r/n)^{n}\right] ^{T}=e^{rT}\)` .

---
class: MSU
# Discrete-Time Models

Suppose there is some set of periods `\(0,1,2,...,T\)` (perhaps `\(T=\infty\)` ).

- Note: The length of a period might be one year, one month, one day, or whatever is most appropriate for the particular application.

Suppose there is a per-period interest rate `\(r\)`, and interest is compounded every period.

If `\(P_{t}\)` is the principal in your bank account in period `\(t\)`, then:


- `\(P_{1}=(1+r)\ast P_{0}\)`

- `\(P_{2}=(1+r)^{2}\ast P_{0}\)`

- `\(P_{t}=(1+r)^{t}\ast P_{0}\)`

- `\(P_{6}=(1+r)\ast P_{5}\)`

- `\(P_{6}=(1+r)^{4}\ast P_{2}\)`

- `\(P_{t+x}=(1+r)^{x}\ast P_{t}\)`

# Present Discounted Value (PDV)

Suppose that you will be paid $1100 one year from today. If the market interest rate is 10% (and yearly compounding), how much is this future payment be worth to you now?

--

We can answer this question by asking how much you could borrow now such that you would have to pay back exactly $1100 in one year.

- Answer: $1000 --- because `\((1.10)\ast(1000)=1100\)` .


--

**Definition**: Given per-period interest rate `\(r\)`, the *present discounted value* (or sometimes just *present value* or *PDV*) of `\(P\)` to be paid `\(T\)` periods in the future is

`$$\frac{P}{(1+r)^{T}}$$`


---
class: MSU
# Present Discounted Value (PDV)

Some `\(PDV\)` 's for `\(P=1000\)` and yearly compounding:


| `\(r\)` | 1 Year | 2 Years | 3 Years | 10 Years | 20 Years |
|:---:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| 3% | $971 | $943 | $915 | $744 | $554 |
| 4% | $962 | $925 | $889 | $676 | $456 |
| 5% | $952 | $907 | $864 | $614 | $377 |
| 6% | $943 | $890 | $840 | $558 | $312 |
| 7% | $935 | $873 | $816 | $508 | $258 |

# PDV of a Stream of Payoffs

Suppose that you will be paid $1100 one year from today, another $1100 two years from today, and yet another $1100 three years from today.

--

If the market interest rate is 10% (and yearly compounding), how much is this stream of payoffs worth to you now?

**Answer:** Add up the individual `\(PDV\)` bit-by-bit:

$$PDV=\frac{\$1100}{(1.10)}+\frac{\$1100}{(1.10)^{2}}+\frac{\$1100}{(1.10)^{3}}=\$2735.54.$$

--

More generally: Given per-period interest rate `\(r\)`, a stream of future revenues `\((R_{1},R_{2},...,R_{N})\)` (where revenue `\(R_{n}\)` is received in period `\(n\)`) has a present discounted value of:


`$$PDV=\frac{R_{1}}{(1+r)}+\frac{R_{2}}{(1+r)^{2}}+...+\frac{R_{N}}{(1+r)^{N}}.$$`

---
class: MSU
# Time-Varying Interest Rates

**Definition:** The *period-* `\(t\)` *interest rate* `\(r_{t}\)` is the interest rate between period `\(t\)` and period `\(t+1\)`. In other words, if in period `\(t\)` your principal is `\(P_{t}\)`, then in period `\(t+1\)` it becomes `\(P_{t+1}=(1+r_{t})P_{t}\)`.

--

Hence, if `\(P_{t}\)` is the principal in your bank account in period `\(t\)`, and if your bank account pays per-period interest rates `\((r_{t},r_{t+1},...)\)`,
then:


- `\(P_{t+1}=(1+r_{t})P_{t}\)`.

- `\(P_{t+2}=(1+r_{t+1})P_{t+1}=(1+r_{t+1})(1+r_{t})P_{t}\)`.

- `\(P_{t+3}=(1+r_{t+2})P_{t+2}=(1+r_{t+2})(1+r_{t+1})(1+r_{t})P_{t}\)`.

- And so on....

---
class: MSU
# Time-Varying Interest Rates

Given per-period interest rates `\((r_{t},r_{t+1},...)\)`, a stream of future
revenues `\((R_{t+1},R_{t+2},R_{t+3})\)` has a present discounted value of

`$$PDV = \frac{R_{t+1}}{(1+r_{t})}+\frac{R_{t+2}}{(1+r_{t})(1+r_{t+1})}+\frac{R_{t+3}}{(1+r_{t})(1+r_{t+1})(1+r_{t+2})}.$$`

# End of Warm-Up 

As always, you will *not* need to memorize any of these equations. But we want to remind ourselves how to think about choices across time. 

- How do you assess today versus tomorrow? 
- What is the "correct" weight to put on money today versus money tomorrow? 
- What determines this tradeoff? 

We'll explore these questions (and many more) coming up.
